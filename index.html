    <p>Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookie Stores. When we talk about Northwest, we must talk about salmon. We eat salmon whichever way we have imagined. Pat's Salmon Cookie Stores want to add to our ever growing imagination of eating salmon. Pat's Salmon Cookie is the first to use salmon as a dessert. Since then, our stores have been growing.
